This arrangement of Pachelbel's Canon was arranged for a wedding reception.

The script:
3m of part 1 while bridal party enters reception hall,
announced one couple at a time.  Cut to resolve after last couple.
30s to 1m for the newlywed couple entrance with part 2 (Rock!)

The rock section is inspired by Jerry C's Canon Rock (see youtube).

This would sound much better with an actual electric guitar, electric bass,
and a drummer.  Two violins don't quite do it justice.

The arrangement for Solo violin was scribbled at the last minute
due to the unavailability of a second violin.
It resembles a cross between the original Canon and a Bach Solo Partita.
