This arrangement of Pachelbel's Canon was arranged for 
a wedding reception.
the script:
3m of part 1 while bridal party enters reception hall,
announced one couple at a time.
30s to 1m for the newlywed couple entrance with part 2 (Rock!)

The rock section is inspired by Jerry C's Canon Rock.

This would sound much better with electric guitar and bass
and a drummer.  Two violins don't quite do it justice.
